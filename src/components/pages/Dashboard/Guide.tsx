        This course is designed with English speakers in mind. It therefore uses
        lessons where words are written phonetically in latin script. This
        simplified course enables English speakers to pick up some
        conversational Farsi before moving onto learning Arabic script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the Farsi learning resources teach based off the Arabic script.
        This course enables new learners to quickly pick up new words and
        phrases without the requirement to learn a new alphabet and writing
        system.

        It's recommended to rote learn the words for each module using the{" "}
        <b>glossary</b> first. There is also a <b>glossary button </b> in each
        module's test for reference in the bottom right of the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have familiarised yourself with the words in the glossary, you
        can test your knowledge using the tests in each module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each module is displayed in the navigation on the left of the screen.

        The approach to learning taken in this course is learning through
        repetition. It's advised that you test yourself regularly in order to
        revise and cememnt the knowledge you have gained.
